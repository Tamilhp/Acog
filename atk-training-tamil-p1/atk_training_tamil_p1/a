Hey dude

Hey there! How can I help you?

Hey is there any specific end character in a file in python?

Yes, in Python, every file will end with a special character called the End-Of-File (EOF) character. It is represented by a single character, usually the ASCII character '\0' (null character). When the EOF character is encountered, the Python interpreter knows that it has reached the end of the file.

Ok. How can I use this EOF character in a terminate condition?

You can use the EOF character as part of a termination condition when looping through a file. You would do this by checking to see if the character read is the EOF character. If it is, you can exit the loop. For example: 

while True:
    char = file.read(1)
    if char == '\0':
        break  # Exit the loop
