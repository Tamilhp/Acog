HEY DUDE
HEY THERE! HOW CAN I HELP YOU?
HEY IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC END CHARACTER IN FILE IN PYTHON?
YES, IN PYTHON, EVERY FILE WILL END WITH SPECIAL CHARACTER CALLED END-OF-FILE (EOF) CHARACTER. IT IS REPRESENTED BY SINGLE CHARACTER, USUALLY ASCII CHARACTER '\0' (NULL CHARACTER). WHEN EOF CHARACTER IS ENCOUNTERED, PYTHON INTERPRETER KNOWS THAT IT HAS REACHED END OF FILE.
OK. HOW CAN I USE THIS EOF CHARACTER IN TERMINATE CONDITION?
YOU CAN USE EOF CHARACTER AS PART OF TERMINATION CONDITION WHEN LOOPING THROUGH FILE. YOU WOULD DO THIS BY CHECKING TO SEE IF CHARACTER READ IS EOF CHARACTER. IF IT IS, YOU CAN EXIT LOOP. FOR EXAMPLE:
WHILE TRUE:
CHAR = FILE.READ(1)
IF CHAR == '\0':
BREAK # EXIT LOOP
