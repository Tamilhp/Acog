`time <./bash_file_name.sh>`

1 `Complement.sh` :
This code is to obtain the reverse complement of a ATCG sequence.
eg. input: AAAACCCGGT 
    output: ACCGGGTTTT

2 `count.sh` :
This code is to obtain the count of "A","C","G","T" present in the sequence.

3 `gccontent.sh` :
This code is to obtain the percentage of "GC" present in overall sequence containing "ACGT".

4 `reccurance.sh` :
This bash code is to calculate the total number of rabbit pairs will be there after "n" moths providing that each rabbit pair reproduces "k" number of offspring pairs after every 1 alternate month.


5 `transcription.sh` :
This bash code is to replace the "T" present in the sequence with "U".
