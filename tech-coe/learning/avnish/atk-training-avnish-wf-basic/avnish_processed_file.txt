THE TESTING PARAGRAPH WE ARE USING FOR THIS EXERCISE CONTAINS A VARIETY OF STOPWORDS, INCLUDING "THE," "AND," "BUT," "IS," "ARE," "WAS," "WERE," "OF," "FOR," AND "WITH
" THESE WORDS ARE OFTEN USED AS FILLER IN SPOKEN AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE, AND THEY ARE USUALLY NOT VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE OVERALL MEANING OF A SENTENCE OR PARAGRAPH
 HOWEVER, THEY CAN BE USEFUL FOR DEMONSTRATING HOW CERTAIN ALGORITHMS OR SYSTEMS HANDLE STOPWORDS, OR FOR TESTING THE PERFORMANCE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TASKS
 DESPITE THEIR FREQUENCY AND RELATIVE UNIMPORTANCE, STOPWORDS CAN STILL PLAY A ROLE IN THE CONTEXT AND STRUCTURE OF A SENTENCE, AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THEIR PRESENCE WHEN ANALYZING LANGUAGE DATA
