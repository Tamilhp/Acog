long_description: >
  Users should be able to refer to questions to ChatGPT via bot commands, after installing the bot in a space. See [Twilinks bot](https://script.gs/introducing-twilinks-a-chat-app-built-using-apps-script/) for an example of how this can be done.

  Here are the commands to support.
  /gptconfig - Command to initiate authorization of bot to use user's openai account
  /gptmsg - Command to send a message to ChatGPT and get back response. Session ID should be inferred from thread ID.
